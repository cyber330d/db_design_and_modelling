Database normalization is the process of organizing data in a database to reduce redundancy and dependency by
organizing fields and table of a database to reduce redundancy and dependency by organizing fields and tables
of a database to reduce redundancy


There are generally five normal forms (1NF, 2NF, 3NF, 4NF, and 5NF) in database normalization theory.
Each normal form represents a different level of organization and dependency among the attributes (columns) 
in a relational database table. Here’s a brief overview of each:

1. **First Normal Form (1NF)**:
   - Eliminates repeating groups within a table by ensuring that each column contains atomic (indivisible) values.
   - Ensures that there are no repeating groups or arrays within cells.

2. **Second Normal Form (2NF)**:
   - Requires that a table is in 1NF and all non-key attributes are fully functional dependent on the primary key.
   - Eliminates partial dependencies, where an attribute depends on only part of the primary key.

3. **Third Normal Form (3NF)**:
   - Requires that a table is in 2NF and all non-key attributes are non-transitively dependent on the primary key.
   - Eliminates transitive dependencies, where an attribute depends on another non-key attribute.

4. **Boyce-Codd Normal Form (BCNF)**:
   - A stricter version of 3NF, specifically for tables with multiple candidate keys.
   - Ensures that all determinants are candidate keys.

5. **Fourth Normal Form (4NF)**:
   - Addresses multi-valued dependencies where a table contains more than one independent multi-valued attribute.
   - Ensures that a table is in BCNF and has no multi-valued dependencies.

6. **Fifth Normal Form (5NF)**:
   - Addresses cases where a table has a join dependency.
   - Ensures that a table is in 4NF and all join dependencies are removed.

These normal forms progressively reduce data redundancy and anomalies, ensuring data integrity and efficient database design.
Each higher normal form builds upon the requirements of the previous ones, with the goal of minimizing redundancy and ensuring
data can be manipulated and queried efficiently without unexpected behaviors.




A squeeze page is a web page made for capturing potential customers’ email addresses. It’s a common practice for these pages to offer free ebooks, educational emails, videos, and more, in exchange for a visitor’s email address or other data. At first sight, squeeze pages resemble landing pages, but they’re slightly different.
